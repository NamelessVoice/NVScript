To build, open NVScript.sln in Visual Studio (2017 or later.)

1) Change the configuration in the toolbar to one of:
	Release		- Build for Thief 2
	ReleaseSS2	- Build for System Shock 2
	ReleaseT1	- Build for Thief: The Dark Project

	(Debug builds likely won't work, as the file size tends to be larger than Dark will load)

2) Click "Build"

3) The script module will be built and copied into "output" folder.
   NVDebug will also be built (but not copied into the output folder - find it in the relevant "Release" folder.)


There are also old makefiles and batch scripts for building using G++ with a CygWin / MingW environment.
I wouldn't recommend using them, as I have no idea if they still work.  They are provided purely for academic interest.
