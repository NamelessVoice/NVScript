To build, open NVScript.sln in Visual Studio (2017 or later.)

1) Change the configuration in the toolbar to one of:
	Release		- Build for Thief 2
	ReleaseSS2	- Build for System Shock 2
	ReleaseT1	- Build for Thief: The Dark Project

	(Debug builds likely won't work, as the file size tends to be larger than Dark will load)

2) Click "Build"

3) The script module will be built into the relevant Release folder.
   NVDebug will also be built - find it in the relevant "Release" folder.

4) The relevant Deploy script will be run after the build has completed (Deploy-T2.cmd, Deploy-SS2.cmd, Deploy-T1);
   these can be set up to automatically copy the created files to wherever they are needed, edit as needed.


There are also old makefiles and batch scripts for building using G++ with a CygWin / MingW environment.
I wouldn't recommend using them, as I have no idea if they still work.  They are provided purely for academic interest.
