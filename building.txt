Building requires either:
	a) Visual Studio 2017 or later
	b) Another C++ IDE, such as Rider, with appropriate MSBuild tools installed.

By default, NVScript is built using Windows Build tools 141 with Windows XP support.
You will need to install these to build script modules that work on Windows XP.
	Under Visual Studio installer, Modify, Individual components:
	- C++ Windows XP support for VS 2017 (v141) tools
	- MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ - x64/x86 build tools (v14.16)

Alternatively, change the build tool version in all of the project files to a more recent version (you will lose XP support.)



To build using Visual Studio (2017 or later):

1) Open NVScript.sln

2) Change the configuration in the toolbar to one of:
	Release		- Build for Thief 2
	ReleaseSS2	- Build for System Shock 2
	ReleaseT1	- Build for Thief: The Dark Project

	(Debug builds likely won't work, as the file size tends to be larger than Dark will load)

3) Click "Build"

4) The script module will be built into the relevant Release folder.
   NVDebug will also be built - find it in the relevant "Release" folder.

5) The relevant Deploy script will be run after the build has completed (Deploy-T2.cmd, Deploy-SS2.cmd, Deploy-T1);
   these can be set up to automatically copy the created files to wherever they are needed, edit as needed.

There are also old makefiles and batch scripts for building using G++ with a CygWin / MingW environment.
I wouldn't recommend using them, as I have no idea if they still work.  They are provided purely for academic interest.



The project can also be built automatically on GitHub.
Script modules will automatically be created for any commit to either a PR branch or master.
