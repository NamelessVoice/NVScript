The script module "NVScript.osm" may be distributed with your fan missions as 
long as you do not charge for the mission, other than the cost of materials 
alone. You must include the above copyright notice and disclaimer in the 
description of your fan mission. You should replace the words 'THIS SOFTWARE'
with 'NVSCRIPT.OSM'.

I've included the source for my scripts for informational purposes. Most of the
underlying architecture of the scripts was built by Telliamed, and much of the 
stuff in the lg directory was worked out by GayleSaver and Totality. Telliamed
has also made quite a few contributions to improve the interfaces, all of which
he offers unconditionally. But it's actually LGS's code there, we've just been 
reverse-engineering it. So there really isn't anyone claiming ownership of it, 
although it technically should belong to Eidos. But we don't think they're going 
to put up a fuss about it, so long as we play fair. Consider everything in that 
directory to be covered by the DromEd copyright agreement.

Telliamed's Script and ScriptModule are based on well-known code that is common
to all script modules, and he says you may use them in your own script modules.

You may use any or all of NVScriptLib, NVGenericScript, or NVGenericTrigger
in your own scripts.

You may use the ideas and small pieces of code from NVScript, but don't just
copy whole scripts and call them your own.

Please do not distribute NVDebug.osm with a fan mission, unless you have a
very good reason to do so.
